###DeskGuru

A fun practice project for our team to get familiar with project workflows and Git. DeskGuru is a Ruby on Rails, Heroku-hosted web app that allows users to search and book from a selection of exciting desk spaces to 'work from home' from. This project was a great opportunity for us to learn and apply our skills while working collaboratively as a team.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
